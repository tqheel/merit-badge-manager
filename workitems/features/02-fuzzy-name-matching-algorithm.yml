      placeholder: Merit Badge Counselor (MBC) names in the Merit Badge In-Progress Report may not exactly match the names in the Troop Roster, and MBCs don't have Member IDs in the report. This makes it difficult to accurately match MBCs between the two data sources and properly assign them to Scouts working on merit badges.

      description: How would you like to see this solved?
      placeholder: Implement a fuzzy name matching algorithm that can intelligently match MBC names from the Merit Badge In-Progress Report to adult members in the Troop Roster. The algorithm should handle variations in name formatting, nicknames, middle initials, and common name variations to ensure accurate matching even when names don't match exactly.
