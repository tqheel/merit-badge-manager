        When viewing the MBC Workload Summary in the Merit Badge Manager web interface, users currently have limited capabilities for analyzing and acting on the workload data. The existing view shows basic statistics like total assignments, active assignments, and completed assignments for each counselor, but lacks essential features for operational management:

        1. No filtering capabilities to focus on specific subsets of counselors (e.g., overloaded counselors, counselors with no assignments)
        2. Limited sorting options to identify workload patterns or prioritize actions
        3. No export functionality to share data with leadership or use in external reporting
        4. No drill-down capabilities to see detailed scout assignments for each counselor
        5. No visual indicators for workload imbalances or alerts for counselors needing attention
        6. No ability to take quick actions directly from the summary view

        This limits the effectiveness of the MBC Workload Summary as a management tool for making data-driven assignment decisions and balancing counselor workloads.

        Enhance the MBC Workload Summary view with comprehensive filtering, sorting, export, and action capabilities:

        **Filtering & Search:**
        - Filter by workload thresholds (e.g., show only counselors with >X assignments)
        - Filter by assignment status (active only, completed only, mixed)
        - Filter by merit badge categories or specific merit badges
        - Search by counselor name or contact information
        - Filter by recent activity (counselors with recent updates)

        **Enhanced Sorting & Display:**
        - Sort by any column (assignments, completion rates, last activity)
        - Visual indicators for workload levels (color-coded bars or badges)
        - Progress indicators showing completion rates
        - Highlight counselors who may need attention (overloaded or inactive)

        **Export Capabilities:**
        - Export filtered data to Excel with formatting
        - Generate PDF reports with charts and summaries
        - Create CSV exports for external analysis
        - Email reports directly to leadership

        **Drill-down Functionality:**
        - Click on counselor to see detailed scout assignments
        - Show individual merit badge progress for each counselor
        - Display scout contact information for follow-up
        - Link to parent communication tools

        **Quick Actions:**
        - Direct email links for counselor contact
        - Quick assignment actions (reassign scouts, add notes)
        - Mark counselors as temporarily unavailable
        - Generate assignment recommendations based on workload balance

        This enhancement transforms the MBC Workload Summary from a static report into a dynamic management dashboard.
