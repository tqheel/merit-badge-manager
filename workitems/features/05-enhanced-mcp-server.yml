      placeholder: The application needs an enhanced MCP (Model Context Protocol) server to integrate with GitHub Copilot for intelligent queries about Troop data and automated creation of GitHub Issues using appropriate YAML templates. The current MCP server is a basic scaffold that needs full implementation following Anthropic schema specifications.
