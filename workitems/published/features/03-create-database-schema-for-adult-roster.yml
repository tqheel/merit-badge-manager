      value: |
        The application needs a structured database schema to store adult roster data imported from CSV files. Currently, there is no database structure to persist adult member information including:
        - Basic member information (names, contact info, BSA numbers)
        - Training certifications and expiration dates
        - Merit badge counselor certifications
        - Position history and tenure information
        - Demographic and status information

        Create a normalized SQLite database schema with the following tables:

        **Primary Table:**
        - `adults` - Core adult member information including names, contact details, BSA numbers, and basic status fields

        **Related Tables:**
        - `adult_training` - Training certifications with expiration dates (one-to-many relationship)
        - `adult_merit_badges` - Merit badge counselor certifications (one-to-many relationship)
        - `adult_positions` - Position history with tenure information (one-to-many relationship)

        **Implementation Requirements:**
        1. Create database schema creation script with appropriate data types
        2. Add foreign key constraints for referential integrity
        3. Create performance indexes for common lookup patterns
        4. Handle complex data parsing for pipe-separated fields (training, merit badges, positions)
        5. Support for data import from existing CSV roster files
        6. Include database migration capabilities for schema updates

        **Key Features:**
        - Normalized structure to eliminate data redundancy
        - Support for complex tenure tracking and position history
        - Efficient querying for merit badge counselor assignments
        - Training completion and expiration tracking
        - Flexible schema to accommodate future enhancements

        **Reference Documentation:**
        - Database schema specification: `docs/create-db-schema-for-adult-roster.md`
        - CSV data structure analysis included in specification
        - Performance optimization considerations documented
        - Data import parsing requirements detailed

        **Technical Considerations:**
        - Must use SQLite as specified in architecture
        - Schema must support fuzzy name matching for MBC assignments
        - Database changes require change scripts as per coding standards
        - All new functionality must include corresponding tests
        - Schema should be extensible for future web application interface

        **Dependencies:**
        - Requires completion of CSV data import module (#01)
        - Foundation for future MBC assignment features
        - Prerequisite for reporting and export functionality

        **Success Criteria:**
        - Database schema successfully created and tested
        - Adult roster data can be imported and queried
        - Performance indexes demonstrate improved query speed
        - Schema supports all documented CSV data fields
        - Change scripts properly manage database migrations
