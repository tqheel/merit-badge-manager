steps-to-reproduce: |
  1. Import the CSV file `RosterReport_Troop0212B_Roster_by_Unit_Patrol_DOB_Scouts_and_Adults_20250727.csv` using the Streamlit UI.
  2. Observe the validation report indicating skipped rows due to duplicate BSA numbers.
  3. Check the database logs for UNIQUE constraint violation errors.
expected-behavior: |
  - Duplicate rows should be skipped without causing database errors.
  - Validation report should clearly indicate skipped rows and reasons.
actual-behavior: |
  - UNIQUE constraint violation errors occur during data import.
  - Validation report indicates skipped rows but does not prevent database errors.
possible-solutions: |
  - Enhance the `import_roster.py` script to handle duplicates before database insertion.
  - Add logic to validate and skip duplicate entries during the import process.
  - Update the database schema to include CASCADE DELETE constraints where necessary.
additional-notes: |
  - Ensure backward compatibility with adult roster system.
  - Test both adult and youth database schemas for cross-system compatibility.
  - Validate Scout-to-counselor assignment functionality after fixing the issue.
  - Include automated tests for duplicate handling and constraint validation.
  - When in "Development" environment, the UI should provide the detailed error message in a modal window.
