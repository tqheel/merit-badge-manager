  ## Bug Description

  During the CSV import process in the Streamlit UI, the application encounters a "disk I/O error" while attempting to recreate the SQLite database schema. This prevents the database schema from being created and halts the import process, leaving the database empty.

  ## Steps to Reproduce

  1. Place roster CSV file in the `data/` directory.
  2. Run Streamlit UI: `streamlit run streamlit_app.py`.
  3. Navigate to "CSV Import" page.
  4. Click "Import Data" button.
  5. Observe the console output for errors during database schema creation.

  ## Expected Behavior

  - The database schema should be created successfully without errors.
  - Data from the validated CSV files should be imported into the database tables.
  - The database should contain the expected tables and records.

  ## Actual Behavior

  - The database schema creation fails with a "disk I/O error."
  - No tables are created in the database.
  - The database remains empty after the import process.

  ## Primary Issues Identified

  ### 1. Disk I/O Error During Database Schema Creation
  **Location**: `db-scripts/setup_database.py`
  **Problem**: The application encounters a "disk I/O error" while recreating the SQLite database schema.

  **Evidence**:
  - Console output shows: `‚ùå Database error: disk I/O error`.
  - Database file (`merit_badge_manager.db`) is removed but not recreated.

  **Required Fix**:
  - Investigate the cause of the disk I/O error (e.g., file permissions, disk space, SQLite configuration).
  - Ensure proper error handling and recovery during database schema creation.

  ### 2. Missing Data Import Logic After Validation
  **Location**: `scripts/import_roster.py`
  **Problem**: Even if the database schema creation succeeds, the application does not insert validated data into the database tables.

  **Evidence**:
  - Console output shows successful CSV validation but no data import.
  - Database tables remain empty after the import process.

  **Required Fix**:
  - Add logic to insert validated data into the database tables after schema creation.

  ## Secondary Issues

  ### 3. Lack of Error Reporting in Database Operations
  **Problem**: The application does not provide detailed error messages or logs for database failures.

  **Required Fix**:
  - Add comprehensive error reporting and logging for database operations.

  ### 4. Missing Unit Tests for Database Creation and Import
  **Problem**: No unit tests exist to verify database schema creation and data import functionality.

  **Required Fix**:
  - Add unit tests to cover database creation, data import, and error handling scenarios.

  ## Specific Code Areas Requiring Changes

  1. **`db-scripts/setup_database.py`**:
     - Investigate and fix the disk I/O error during schema creation.
     - Add error handling and recovery logic.

  2. **`scripts/import_roster.py`**:
     - Add logic to insert validated data into the database tables.
     - Ensure proper transaction management during data import.

  3. **`streamlit_app.py`**:
     - Update error reporting for database failures.
     - Ensure the UI reflects the status of the import process.

  ## Testing Requirements

  1. **Verify database schema creation**:
     - Test schema creation under various conditions (e.g., file permissions, disk space).
     - Ensure schema creation succeeds without errors.

  2. **Verify data import flow**:
     - Test that validated CSV data is inserted into the database tables.
     - Verify record counts match between CSV files and database tables.

  3. **Error handling tests**:
     - Test recovery from database errors (e.g., disk I/O error).
     - Verify error messages are properly displayed to users.

  ## Success Criteria

  - Database schema is created successfully without errors.
  - Validated CSV data is imported into the database tables.
  - Command `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM adults` returns actual adult count.
  - Command `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM scouts` returns actual scout count.
  - Import errors are properly reported to users.

  ## Environment

  - Python: 3.12
  - SQLite database: `merit_badge_manager.db`
  - Import method: Streamlit UI CSV Import page
  - Branch: copilot/fix-16

  ## Related Files

  - `scripts/import_roster.py` - Contains broken import logic.
  - `streamlit_app.py` - UI that calls the import.
  - `db-scripts/setup_database.py` - Database schema creation.

  ## Priority

  Critical - This prevents the core functionality of the application (data import).
