# GitHub Issue #7 Publishing Fix - Investigation Report

## Problem Summary
GitHub issue #7 "Create Database Schema for Adult Roster Data" was published but displayed empty content in the Problem Statement, Proposed Solution, and Additional Context sections.

## Root Cause Analysis

### Issue Identified
The problem was **YAML formatting**, not the MCP server logic:

1. **Original YAML Structure**: The feature YAML file used single-line formatting for long placeholder text
2. **YAML Parser Behavior**: Long single-line strings were being truncated during YAML parsing
3. **MCP Server Logic**: The `convert_yml_to_github_issue` function was actually working correctly

### Evidence
- The MCP server successfully extracted placeholder content when properly formatted
- Testing showed the conversion function produced complete GitHub issue content
- The GitHub API payload contained the expected data structure

## Solution Implemented

### 1. YAML Formatting Fix
- **Problem**: Long placeholder text on single lines
- **Solution**: Use YAML block literal style (`|`) for multi-line content
- **Example**:
  ```yaml
  # Before (problematic)
  placeholder: Very long single line text that gets truncated...
  
  # After (fixed)
  placeholder: |
    Multi-line text properly formatted
    with YAML block literal syntax
  ```

### 2. Enhanced MCP Server
- Added comprehensive documentation to the conversion function
- Added all requested MCP tools for complete GitHub integration:
  - `list_published_features`
  - `get_feature_details` 
  - `publish_bug`
  - `list_bugs`
  - `list_published_bugs`
  - `get_bug_details`

### 3. Test Cases Created
- Created test YAML files with proper formatting
- Verified complete content extraction
- Confirmed GitHub issue generation works correctly

## Files Modified

### Fixed YAML Templates
- `workitems/features/test-yaml-publishing-fix.yml` - Test case for debugging
- `workitems/features/02-csv-data-import-module-corrected.yml` - Corrected version of original feature

### Enhanced MCP Server
- `mcp_server/main.py` - Added missing MCP tools and enhanced documentation

## Verification Results

✅ **Problem Statement**: Full content extracted and formatted  
✅ **Proposed Solution**: Complete solution description included  
✅ **Additional Context**: All technical requirements and compliance notes present  
✅ **MCP Tools**: All requested GitHub integration tools implemented  
✅ **YAML Parsing**: Multi-line content properly handled with `|` syntax  

## Recommendations

### For Future YAML Files
1. Always use YAML block literal syntax (`|`) for multi-line placeholder content
2. Test YAML parsing locally before publishing to GitHub
3. Keep placeholder content under reasonable length limits

### For MCP Server
1. Consider adding YAML validation to catch formatting issues early
2. Add content length checks to warn about potential truncation
3. Implement preview functionality to verify content before publishing

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: The fix is complete and tested
2. **Optional**: Republish issue #7 with corrected content using the fixed YAML template
3. **Future**: Apply proper YAML formatting to all existing feature/bug templates
